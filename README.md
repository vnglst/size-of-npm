Size of `node_modules` folder when installing the top 100 packages shown over time.

**Note:** Even though this is called size of NPM, it's actually using yarn to install the dependencies (force of habit on my part). Now that it's been running for more than 6 month and don't want the change anything. I did find out, however, that npm install gives me a **smaller** node_modules folder.
